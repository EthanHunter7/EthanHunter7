# Hello There :smiley:

I'm a young adult looking for an apprenticeship in Front-end Web Development/Software Development in the North East of England. 

* My most complex project is [The Ghostly Coder](https://github.com/EthanHunter7/TheGhostlyCoder) :ghost:
 
 
 ## Courses 
 

 ### Baltic Apprenticeships Software Academy

I attended the baltic apprenticeships software academy which is a 2-week Bootcamp. Within this 2-week course, I was taught the fundamentals of HTML/PHP and some basics about the software development life cycle and then we produced a project at the end to show what we had learnt at the end of it.

It was a really good experience. It helped me understand more about the industry and what goes on behind the scenes and the work put into it. Also with it being my first big project getting a final product after working on it for a little while was a great feeling.

You can see the project I made for the Bootcamp [here](https://github.com/EthanHunter7/TheGhostlyCoder "The Ghostly Coder")

I was given a certificate of completion which can be viewed [here](/Certificate%20of%20Completion%20-%20Ethan%20Hunter.pdf "Views Certificate")

### Codecademy

I am currently doing some Codecademy courses. I'm doing the full stack developer course but the curriculum is mainly based on the front-end at this moment in time 

During my time doing the full stack developer course I have learnt about the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, I have also learnt some improved styling skills within CSS e.g. Buttons and Nav Bars. 

I also have a basic understanding of using Git and Github from learning a little bit of it from Codecademy as well as some self-research. 

While I have been doing this Codecademy course they asked me to do some off-platform projects which I have completed and added to my repositories. 

The off-platform projects that are in my repositories are 
* [CheatSheet](https://github.com/EthanHunter7/CheatSheet)
* [Dasmoto-s-arts](https://github.com/EthanHunter7/Dasmoto-s-arts)
* [DesignSystem](https://github.com/EthanHunter7/DesignSystem)

I have also completed the Codecademy Learn JavaScript course which you can view the certificate [here](/Java%20Script%20Certificate.pdf)
